To convert to F7

First set up routes. F7 does not work with vue-router. But f7 router may actually be easier to work with.

f7-view is the equivalent of router-link.

If you want the view to pop out put it inside f7-panel tag

F7 is a true SPA framework. It is designed to work in ONE PAGE.

Whatever you have set up as the '/' route, that's your navbar



build a static supplies object into config.js and export it

To start I may not even need vuex...
