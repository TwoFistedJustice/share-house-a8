Still to do:
  check if member is admin prior to boot
  change name of house
  show featureset

  integrate chore and supplies


DONE to Refactor away from storing a members array in firebase to using a pure object:

patch the pushId just before .json and then pass the data you want to store in that node

DONE house/createNewHouse -
		- Remove the members array
		- Remove the push command
		- Pass payload to member/addmember
				userId and isAdmin:true


DONE Addeded new Action: "addCreatorToHouse"


 DONE-    house/fetchActiveHouse
	- Need to convert members object into a usable array for state use.
		- try Array.from(obj) - this just creates an empty array of length zero
		-  Use for (let variable in object)
				- push each variable into a new array
				- Now you have an array of IDs you can use to get the member info
				-- OOPS that's way harder than it needs to be
				-- the object and array are always of same length so only one loop is needed
				- user the for-in loop with object[square bracket notation] to get data


  DONE  member/addMember
		- Refactor to accept payload {userId, isAdmin}
		- unless payload is passed at house creation, isAdmin is false
		- Check if they are a member
		- if not, patch a new node to house/members


	user/setUserInfo
		- I don't think any changes are needed, but we shall see


  DONE member/removeMember
	- Refactor to delete node matching passed userid
	- this should shorten the function by A LOT
	- -- This is A LOT shorter now!! :-)
