Deprecate userModule's admin info - get it from houseModule instead

Need to set userinfo from housemodule - but async get admin is fucking it all up!


For AdminHouse:
    X need to get user and admin info into active house
    lookin  fetch active house - inside get
    - MODEL FROM FETCHUSER
    maybe setActiveHouse
    I should be getting admin info in fetchActiveHouse,
      then userInfo can get it from actyive house members

For A8
  Full integration of Supplies and ChoreWheel
  FeatureSet nodes are only added to a house when the first supply or chore is added
  When the last supply or chore is deleted,



MAJOR CHANGES
  DONE - Need to show who is Admin and who is not
  Admins need to be able to add admins
  ** Remove members from house with double switch protection
  When all members are removed, house goes bye bye along with all its data




NEXT UP:
  Adminstrate House
      Show/change name of house
      Delete house
      Show Admins of House - have it show Admin next to the appropriate members
      Show Members of House
          - Delete member
      Show featureSet




** BUGS AND SOLUTIONS **


UNRESOLVED BUGS


BUG: User Info no longer displays anywhere
